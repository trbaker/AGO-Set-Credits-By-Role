# AGO-Set-Credits-By-Role

Allows the AGO school organizational administrator to set the assigned credits based on role type (custom or built-in).

This script sets all users (of the specified role type) at once while the "out-of-the-box" administrator tools requires an administrator to manually add each username to the affected list. This can be a very useful tool where students are assigned a role based on a criteria and updated credit limits need to be assigned.
